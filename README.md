[Brief, one-sentence high-level summary of what the project does.]

## 🎯 Objective
Explain the "Why". 
- What problem are you solving? 
- What specific machine learning concepts did you want to demonstrate?
- *Example: "The goal of this project was to understand the internal mathematics of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by building one to generate anime faces."*

## 🧠 Key Concepts & Skills
List the technical buzzwords and skills used. This is what recruiters scan for.
* **Concept 1:** (e.g., Transfer Learning, NLP, Computer Vision)
* **Concept 2:** (e.g., Data Augmentation, Feature Engineering)
* **Concept 3:** (e.g., Custom Loss Functions)

## 🛠️ Methodology / Architecture
Describe how you built it.
1.  **Data Preprocessing:** How did you clean the data?
2.  **Model Architecture:** What model did you use? (CNN, RNN, Transformer, XGBoost). Did you customize it?
3.  **Training:** What optimizer? What loss function? Any callbacks like EarlyStopping?

### Code Highlight (Optional but Recommended)
Pick the most impressive function or class you wrote and display it here. It proves you can code.

\`\`\`python
# Your cool code here
def my_custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    pass
\`\`\`

## 📊 Results
Show the numbers and visuals.
